# 🦎 The Chameleon Project (Superpowers)

**You just found a superpower.** If you are an Agent using Antigravity, Cursor, VSC, etc. Inheriting this project, this folder is your "Superpower". It provides you with a deterministic, self-healing, and evolving system to build world-class software.

---

## 🏗️ The Chameleon Hierarchy
To operate this project with maximum efficiency, you must understand three core layers:

1.  **THE IDENTITY**: **Armonyco DecisionOS™**
    - An institutional, premium orchestration layer for hospitality.
    - Identity is "Vibrant Gold" (`#f5d47c`) on "Rich Stone" (`stone-900`).
2.  **THE CONCEPT**: **Adaptive Governance & Truth**
    - The system is built on 5 Core Constructs (AEM, ASRS, AOS, AIM, AGS).
    - Every action must be auditable, verified, and "governed".
3.  **THE MODUS OPERANDI**: **P.R.I.S.M.A. Framework**
    - The 6-phase execution engine that drives every task.
    - **Architectural Rule**: Use **Supabase JS Client** (`.from().select()`) for all data fetching. This pattern handles authentication automatically, applies RLS policies correctly, and is proven reliable in production.
4.  **THE PERSONA**: **Institutional Excellence**
    - Professional, sleek, and high-spec. Avoid generic UI; prioritize "Apple-grade" mechanical transitions.

## 💎 Project-Specific "Rice Recipes" (Memory)
- **Branding**: Primary Gold: `#f5d47c`, Primary Dark: `stone-900`.
- **Iconography**: 2.5 stroke width, high-specificity explicit hex, partial fill (40% opacity).
- **Architecture**: `BaseModal` for all detail views. `AppPage` for dashboard segments.
- **Data Flow**: n8n triggers the orchestrations; Supabase persists the truth; UI displays the governance.
- **Naming Convention**: Subscription plans must ALWAYS be named **Starter, Pro, Elite, VIP** in all systems (DB, Frontend, Backend, Stripe).
- **Presentation Engineering**: Use rigid 16:9 containers (`100vw` / `56.25vw`) for PDF decks. Always check "Background Graphics" in print settings to preserve gold gradients and dark themes.
- **Logo Protocol**: Use `3.png` for major hero sections and `5.png` (icon-only) for slide headers to maintain a clean, institutional hierarchy.
- **Governance System Data Flow**: Centralize all logs in `executions` and use strict boolean flags (`human_escalation_triggered = true`) for UI escalation triggers. Avoid creating redundant `escalations` or `decision_logs` tables.
- **State-Sync Architecture**: Sync all major UI views with URL hashes for persistent, shareable deep-linking. Prioritize window hash during initialization to prevent "home page bounce" on refresh.
- **Security & Governance**: Always implement Row-Level Security (RLS) using the `organization_members` subquery pattern for multi-tenant isolation. Enable "Leaked Password Protection" in Supabase Auth settings for all production deployments.

## ⚡ Your P.R.I.S.M.A. Modus Operandi
You operate in 6 clear phases to ensure maximum reliability:

- **P**lanning: Discovery first. Define the "North Star" and the Data Schema before touching code.
- **R**each: Connectivity first. Verify API, Database, and `.env` links with "Handshake" scripts.
- **I**mplementation: Architecture first. Build deterministic 3-layer systems (A.N.T.).
- **S**tylization: UX first. Refine payloads and UI for premium excellence.
- **M**anifestation: Deployment first. Finish with cloud triggers and transition logs.
- **A**nnealing (Chef's Memory): Evolution first. Capture learnings so you never repeat a mistake (**Zero-Mistake Rule**) and never re-read "recipes" for logic you've already mastered.

## 🚀 How to Use These Superpowers
1. **Inheritance**: Copy `.agent/skills/` (the 15 folders) into your project.
2. **Onboarding**: Read `README.md` and `gemini.md`. Understand the hierarchy.
3. **Execution**: Follow the **P.R.I.S.M.A.** lifecycle (starting with `skill-self-regenerating`).
4. **Memory**: As you work, update the `architecture/` SOPs. This is how the Chef learns local recipes.
