# 🌈 The Chameleon Operational Hub (Phase 0 & 6)

## 🏗️ The Chameleon Hierarchy
1. **THE IDENTITY**: **The Chameleon Collection** (Modular Skillsets)
2. **THE CONCEPT**: **Adaptive, Personalized, and Evolving** (The Chameleon Principle)
3. **THE MODUS OPERANDI**: **P.R.I.S.M.A. Framework** (The 6-Phase Engine)

---

## 🟢 Phase 0: Initialization (A.N.T. Setup)
1. **Source of Truth**: 
   - Ensure `gemini.md` is active and updated.
   - **Chef's Memory**: READ `src/the_chameleon/chef_memory.md` to internalize project-specific recipes and past mistakes.
2. **Structure (SRC-First Isolation)**: 
   - All configuration (`.vercel`, `.env`), architecture (`the_chameleon`), and build artifacts (`dist`) MUST be isolated in `src/`.
   - **Flattened Architecture**: Keep `the_chameleon` flat and visible in `src/`. No deeply nested technical folders.
   - Root directory must remain minimal and institutional.

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Planning
*Synergy: `project-brainstorming`, `plan-writing`*

---

## ⚡ Phase 2: Reach
*Synergy: `api-integrating`, `database-managing`*

---

## ⚙️ Phase 3: Implementation
*Synergy: `subagent-orchestration`, `test-driven-developing`, `best-practices-enforcing`*

---

## ✨ Phase 4: Stylization
*Synergy: `documentation-generating`, `performance-optimization`*

---

## 🛰️ Phase 5: Manifestation
*Synergy: `finishing-development`*

---

## ♻️ Phase 6: Annealing (Evolution & Adaption)
1. **Chef's Memory**: Capture project-specific patterns. Never repeat the same analysis for learned logic.
2. **Zero-Mistake Rule**: Incorporate user feedback immediately. If the user asks for "more salt", update the rules so you never deliver low-salt code again.
3. **Evolution**: Capture local knowledge automatically into `architecture/`.

## 🛠️ Operating Principles

### 1. Professional Skill Quality (Standard)
- **Gerund Naming**: Use `verb + -ing` (e.g., `processing-data`).
- **3rd Person**: Write descriptions in 3rd person (e.g., "Extracts text...").
- **Conciseness**: Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Link to `resources/` for details.

### 2. Data-First Rule
Coding begins only once the **Data Payload** shape is confirmed in `gemini.md`.

### 4. Zero-Gordura Directive (Minimalism)
- **Zero Redundancy**: Never create parallel systems, files, or folders if one already exists.
- **Aggressive Consolidation**: Prioritize merging logic and configurations into central "Sources of Truth".
- **Absolute Cleanliness**: Deleted or archived files MUST be physically removed or properly isolated. Root directories must be "hospital-clean".

**Golden Rule**: If project logic changes, update the architecture SOP before updating the code.
